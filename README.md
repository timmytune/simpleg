# Simpleg

Simple, lightweight, Activerecord like, embeded graph database written in go.


## Why Simpleg?

Graph databases are cool (check [here](https://dzone.com/articles/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-using-a-graph-databa) to know more) but they are quite expensive to use, Google and Facebook can spin up hundreds of 64GB memory servers to handle their graph database but i doubt if there is anyone out there willing to setup an 8GB memory server to host the database for a pet project. This is where Simpleg comes in removing the overkill features like accepting data over a network, dedicated interaction language and multiple server coordination features to give you a database you can host in your 1GB VPS without any issues while providing all the necessary graph database features. Simpleg uses [Badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger/) as it's internal key value store thereby bringing the power of one of the top key value databases (also used by [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/) internally) out there. Simpleg is also built with a flexible and easily extensible core giving you the opprtunity to extend with functionalities that suite your needs without modifications to the core!
